class SDKConnector(Connector):
    """
    This class represents one connection through the public python SDK.

    One connection means one session.
    If you have multiple, identical, SDKConnectors it represents having
    multiple login from the same user.

    Associated with each object is a C{Service} object from the SDK which in
    turn contains connection info, namespace and auth.

    When a connector is logged in an auth token is generated and will be kept
    until the point that you logout or the server is restarted.

    The connector reads ports, host and scheme from the given Splunk instance.
    When Splunk is restarted the info is read again to reflect any changes
    that were made.

    When Splunk is restarted the connector I{tries} to login again if the
    connector was logged in before. This might not always work (if you disabled
    auth for instance) though.

    The Python SDK, as of version 0.8.0, uses separate parameters to evaluate
    the namespace. Therefor the primary parameters to be used are 'owner', 'app'
    and 'sharing' instead of namespace. See splunklib.binding for more info.

    @cvar DEFAULT_SHARING: The default sharing option, as defined by the
                        Python SDK in splunklib.binding, that will be used
                        if it isn't specified by the user.
    @cvar DEFAULT_OWNER: The default owner that will be used if it isn't
                        specified by the user.
    @cvar DEFAULT_APP: The default app that will be used if it isn't
                        specified by the user.
