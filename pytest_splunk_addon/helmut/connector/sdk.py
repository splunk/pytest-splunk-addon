class SDKConnector:
    """
    This class represents one connection through the public python SDK.

    One connection means one session.
    If you have multiple, identical, SDKConnectors it represents having
    multiple login from the same user.

    Associated with each object is a C{Service} object from the SDK which in
    turn contains connection info and auth.

    When a connector is logged in an auth token is generated and will be kept
    until the point that you logout or the server is restarted.

    The connector reads ports, host and scheme from the given Splunk instance.
    When Splunk is restarted the info is read again to reflect any changes
    that were made.

    When Splunk is restarted the connector I{tries} to login again if the
    connector was logged in before. This might not always work (if you disabled
    auth for instance) though.
