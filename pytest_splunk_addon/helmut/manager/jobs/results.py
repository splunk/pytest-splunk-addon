class Results(object):
    """
    A class that represents a result set.

    These results can be represented in two ways; as a list or as a dictionary.

    The formats are:

    List::
        [
            {
                'field1': value1,
                'field2': value2,
                ...
            },

            {
                'field2': value3,
                'field3': value4,
                ...
            }
        ]

    Dictionary::
        {
            'field1': [value1, None, ...],
            'field2': [value2, value3, ...],
            'field3': [None, value4, ...],
            ...
        }

    As you can see each event in the list doesn't have to contain all fields.

    @ivar _list: The results as a list
    @ivar _dict_cached: Since creating the dictionary is expensive it's cached.
                        You should use the _dict property though!
