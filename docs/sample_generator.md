# Data Generator

To ingest samples into Splunk, plugin takes `pytest-splunk-addon-data.conf` as input.
The sample generation & ingestion takes place before executing the testcases.
For index-time test cases, there are multiple metadata required about the sample file for which `pytest-splunk-addon-data.conf` must be created and provided to the pytest command.


## pytest-splunk-addon-data.conf.spec

**Default Values**:

```
[default]
host_type = plugin
input_type = default
index = main
sourcetype = pytest-splunk-addon
source = pytest-splunk-addon:{{input_type}}
sourcetype_to_search = {{sourcetype}}
sample_count = 1
timestamp_type = event
count = 0
earliest = now
latest = now
timezone = 0000
breaker = {{regex}}
host_prefix = {{host_prefix}}
```

**[<sample file name\>]**

- The stanza can contain the sample File Name or Regex to match multiple sample files.
- The sample file should be located in samples folder under the Add-on package.
- Example1: \[sample_file.samples\] would collect samples from file sample_file.samples
- Example2: \[sample\_\*.samples\] would collect samples from both sample_file.samples and sample_sample.samples.

**sourcetype = <sourcetype\>**

- sourcetype to be assigned to the sample events

**source = <source\>**

- source to be assigned to the sample events
  - default value: pytest-splunk-addon:{\{input_type}}


**sourcetype_to_search = <sourcetype\>**

- The sourcetype used to search events
  - This would be different then sourcetype= param in cases where TRANSFORMS is used to update the sourcetype index time.

**host_type = plugin | event**

- This key determines if host is assigned from event or default host should be assigned by plugin.
- If the value is plugin, the plugin will generate host with format of "stanza\_\{count}" to uniquely identify the events.
- If the value is event, the host field should be provided for a token using "token.<n\>.field = host".

**input_type = modinput | scripted_input | syslog_tcp | file_monitor | windows_input | uf_file_monitor | default**
 
- The input_type used in addon to ingest data of a sourcetype used in stanza.
- The way with which the sample data is ingested in Splunk depends on Splunk. The most similar ingesting approach is used for each input_type to get accurate index-time testing.
- In input_type=uf_file_monitor, universal forwarder will use file monitor to read event and then it will send data to indexer.
- For example, in an Add-on, a sourcetype "alert" is ingested through syslog in live environment, provide input_type=syslog_tcp.

> **_warning:_**  uf_file_monitor input_type will only work with splunk-type=docker.


**index = <index\>**

- The index used to ingest the data.
- The index must be configured beforehand.
- If the index is not available then the data will not get ingested into Splunk and a warning message will be printed.
- Custom index is not supported for syslog_tcp or syslog_udp

**sample_count = <count\>**

- The no. of events present in the sample file.
- This parameter will be used to calculate the total number of events which will be generated from the sample file.
- If `input_type = modinput`, do not provide this parameter.

**expected_event_count = <count\>**

- The no. of events this sample stanza should generate.
- The parameter will be used to test the line breaking in index-time tests.
- To calculate expected_event_count 2 parameters can be used. 1) Number of events in the sample file. 2) Number of values of replacementType=all tokens in the sample file. Both the parameters can be multiplied to get expected_event_count.
- For example, if sample contains 3 lines & a token has replacement_type=all and replacement has list of 2 values, then 6 events will be generated.
- This parameter is optional, if it is not provided by the user, it will be calculated automatically by the pytest-splunk-addon.

**timestamp_type = plugin | event**

- This key determines if \_time is assigned from event or default \_time should be assigned by plugin.
- The parameter will be used to test the time extraction in index-time tests.
- If value is plugin, the plugin will assign the time while ingesting the event.
- If value is event, that means the time will be extracted from event and therfore, there should be a token provided with token.<n\>.field = \_time.

**breaker = <regex\>**

- The breaker is used to breakdown the sample file into multiple events, based on the regex provided.
- This parameter is optional. If it is not provided by the user, the events will be ingested into Splunk,
as per the *input_type* provided.

**host_prefix = <host_prefix\>**
- This param is used as an identification for the **host** field, for the events which are ingested using SC4S.

## Token replacement settings

The following replacementType -> replacement values are supported

| ReplacementType | Replacement                                                                       |

**token.<n\>.token = <regular expression\>**

- "n" is a number starting at 0, and increasing by 1.
- PCRE expression used to identify segment for replacement.
- If one or more capture groups are present the replacement will be performed on group 1.

**token.<n\>.replacementType = static | timestamp | random | all | file**

- "n" is a number starting at 0, and increasing by 1.
- For static, the token will be replaced with the value specified in the replacement setting.
- For timestamp, the token will be replaced with the strptime specified in the replacement setting. Strptime directive: [https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior](https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior)
- For random, the token will be replaced with a randomly picked type-aware value
- For all, For each possible replacement value, a new event will be generated and the token will be replaced with it. The configuration can be used where a token replacement contains multiple templates/values and all of the values are important and should be ingested at least once. The number of events will be multiplied by the number of values in the replacement. For example, if sample contains 3 lines & a token replacement has list of 2 values, then 6 events will be generated. For a replacement if replacementType='all' is not supported, then be default plugin will consider replacementType="random".
- For file, the token will be replaced with a random value retrieved from a file specified in the replacement setting.

**token.<n\>.replacement = <string\> | <strptime\> | \["list","of","values"\] | guid | ipv4 | ipv6 | mac | integer\[<start\>:<end\>\] | float\[<start\>:<end\>\] | hex(<i\>) | <file name\> | <file name\>:<column number\> | host | src | dest | dvc | user | url | email | src_port | dest_port**

- "n" is a number starting at 0, and increasing by 1.

- For float\[<start\>:<end\>\], the token will be replaced with a random float between start and end values where <end\> is a number greater than or equal to <start\>. For floating point numbers, precision will be based off the precision specified in <start\>. For example, if we specify 1.0, precision will be one digit, if we specify 1.0000, precision will be four digits.

- For hex(<i\>), the token will be replaced with i number of Hexadecimal characters \[0-9A-F\] where "i" is a number greater than 0.

- For list, the token will be replaced with a random member of the JSON list provided. For replacement=all, one event will be generated for each value within the list
